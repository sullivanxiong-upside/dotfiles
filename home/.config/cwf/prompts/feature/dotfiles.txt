# CRITICAL: Symlink Editing in Worktrees

**THE #1 GOTCHA**: When working in feature worktrees, DO NOT edit files through their symlinks.

## The Problem

Many files in this repo are symlinked to their actual locations:
- `~/.claude/settings.json` → `~/repos/dotfiles/.claude/settings.json`
- `~/.tmux.conf` → `~/repos/dotfiles/.tmux.conf`
- `~/.config/zsh/user.zsh` → `~/repos/dotfiles/.config/zsh/user.zsh`

Git worktrees create separate working directories:
- Main repo: `~/repos/dotfiles/.claude/settings.json`
- Feature worktree: `~/repos/dotfiles-feature-my-branch/.claude/settings.json`

**When you edit through symlinks, changes go to the MAIN branch, NOT the worktree.**

## CORRECT Workflow

```bash
# WRONG - Edits main's copy via symlink
gwf wt feature my-feature
vim ~/.claude/settings.json    # Goes to main repo!

# CORRECT - Edit worktree's copy directly
gwf wt feature my-feature
cd ~/repos/dotfiles-feature-my-feature
vim .claude/settings.json      # Edits worktree's copy
```

## Recovery Procedure

If you accidentally edited through symlinks:

```bash
# Save your changes
cd ~/repos/dotfiles
git diff .claude/settings.json > /tmp/my-changes.patch

# Apply to worktree
cd ~/repos/dotfiles-feature-my-branch
git apply /tmp/my-changes.patch

# Restore main's copy
cd ~/repos/dotfiles
git restore .claude/settings.json
```

# Repository-Specific Testing

Different components require different reload procedures:

## tmux Configuration
```bash
# Reload tmux config
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf

# Update plugins (in tmux: Ctrl+A then U)
# Or restart tmux entirely
```

## Claude Settings
```bash
# MUST restart Claude (not --resume)
# Exit current session, then start fresh
claude

# Verify hooks loaded
/hooks
```

## Shell Configuration
```bash
# Reload shell config
source ~/.zshrc
```

## NeoVim Configuration
```bash
# In nvim:
:source ~/.config/nvim/init.lua
# Or restart nvim
```

# Key Points

- This repo contains config files, not code - no automated tests
- Testing is manual: verify the configuration works as expected
- tmux-claude-status plugin is now external (installed via TPM)
- Always edit worktree's local copy when doing feature work
- Check CLAUDE.md in the repo for detailed guidance
