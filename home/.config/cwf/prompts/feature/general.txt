## FIRST: Determine Approach

**IMPORTANT: Before starting work, ask the user:**

"Should we approach this feature with:

**Option 1: Spec PR First (Recommended for complex changes)**
- Write comprehensive specification document
- Get approval before implementation
- Best for: migrations, new architectures, API changes

**Option 2: Direct Implementation**
- Start coding immediately
- Best for: bug fixes, small features, simple updates

Which approach do you prefer?"

**If user chooses Spec PR:** Follow the spec document template from SPEC_PR_GUIDELINES.

**If user chooses Direct Implementation:** Proceed with standard feature work below.

First, identify the repository or codebase we're working in and understand its structure.
