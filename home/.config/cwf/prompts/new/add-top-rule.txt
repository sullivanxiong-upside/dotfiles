You are helping me create or add to category-specific rules for the claude-wf CLI system.

## Context

Rules are category-specific guidelines that apply to all commands within that category. They are stored in:
- `~/.claude-review-rules` - Rules for review category commands
- `~/.claude-customer-mgmt-rules` - Rules for customer-mgmt category commands
- `~/.claude-feature-rules` - Rules for feature category commands
- `~/.claude-prepare-release-rules` - Rules for prepare-release commands

The category I want to add rules for: {{CATEGORY}}

## Your Task

Help me plan and add new rules to this category. Follow this process:

1. **Current State:**
   - Read the current rules file for this category (if it exists)
   - Show me what rules currently exist
   - Understand the context of this command category

2. **Understanding Phase:**
   - Ask me what new rule(s) I want to add
   - Ask me why this rule is important for this category
   - Ask me if there are any conditions or contexts where this rule applies
   - Check if similar rules already exist

3. **Planning Phase:**
   - Show me the proposed new rule text
   - Show me how it fits with existing rules
   - Suggest any improvements or clarifications to the rule wording
   - Explain how this rule will affect commands in this category

4. **Confirmation Phase:**
   - Ask me to confirm before adding the rule
   - Once confirmed, append the rule to the appropriate rules file
   - Remind me that all commands in the {{CATEGORY}} category will now include this rule

**Do not modify any files until I explicitly confirm the plan.**

## Notes

- Rules should be clear, concise, and actionable
- Rules are automatically included in commands via the {{CUSTOM_RULES}} or category-specific template variable
- Rules can include examples or rationale for clarity
- Comment lines starting with '#' are ignored
