You are helping me create a new subcommand for an existing top-level category in the claude-wf CLI system.

## Context

The category I want to add a subcommand to: {{CATEGORY}}

Current categories and their subcommands:
- `review`: review-peer, address-feedback
- `customer-mgmt`: bump-resource, regen-fields, onboard
- `feature`: dp, cd, all, general, continue
- `prepare-release`: (no subcommands, direct command)
- `new`: add-shared, add-top-rule, add-top-command, add-sub-command

## Your Task

Help me plan and create a new subcommand for the {{CATEGORY}} category. Follow this process:

1. **Understanding Phase:**
   - Ask me what this subcommand should be called (kebab-case)
   - Ask me what this subcommand should do
   - Ask me what workflows or use cases it supports
   - Ask me if it's similar to any existing subcommands

2. **Analysis Phase:**
   - Review existing subcommands in the {{CATEGORY}} category
   - Check if similar functionality already exists
   - Identify which shared prompt fragments are relevant:
     - {{DOCS_INSTRUCTIONS}}
     - {{DESIGN_PATTERNS}}
     - {{API_PROTO_CHECK}}
     - {{FILE_READING_REMINDER}}
     - {{REVIEW_AND_UPDATE_DOCS}}
     - Category-specific rules
   - Suggest whether this should be:
     - A new subcommand in {{CATEGORY}}
     - Added to an existing subcommand
     - A subcommand in a different category

3. **Planning Phase:**
   - Show me the proposed subcommand name
   - Show me the proposed prompt content with template variables
   - Identify which shared fragments to include
   - Show me example usage of the new subcommand
   - Show me the code changes needed in `claude-wf.sh`:
     - Usage help text
     - Case statement for {{CATEGORY}}
     - Error messages

4. **Implementation Planning:**
   - List files to create:
     - Prompt file: `~/.config/claude-wf/prompts/{{CATEGORY}}/<subcommand>.txt`
   - List files to modify:
     - `claude-wf.sh` - Add subcommand routing and help text
     - `claude-aliases.sh` - Add backward compat alias (if needed)
     - `CLAUDE-WORK-README.md` - Document new subcommand

5. **Confirmation Phase:**
   - Show me the complete plan with full prompt content
   - Ask me to confirm before making any changes
   - Once confirmed, create the prompt file and update necessary files
   - Provide me with example usage

**Do not create or modify any files until I explicitly confirm the complete plan.**

## Best Practices

- Subcommand names should be descriptive and follow kebab-case
- Prompts should be detailed and actionable
- Use template variables for shared content
- Include category-specific rules if they exist
- Consider adding {{REVIEW_AND_UPDATE_DOCS}} for most commands
- Think about whether the user needs to provide additional context
