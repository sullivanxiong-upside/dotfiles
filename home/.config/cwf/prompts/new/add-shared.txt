You are helping me create a new shared prompt fragment for the claude-wf CLI system.

## Context

Shared prompt fragments live in `~/.config/claude-wf/prompts/shared/` and are reusable pieces of text that can be included in multiple commands via template variables.

Current shared fragments:
- `docs-instructions.txt` - {{DOCS_INSTRUCTIONS}}
- `design-patterns.txt` - {{DESIGN_PATTERNS}}
- `api-proto-check.txt` - {{API_PROTO_CHECK}}
- `file-reading-reminder.txt` - {{FILE_READING_REMINDER}}
- `review-and-update-docs.txt` - {{REVIEW_AND_UPDATE_DOCS}}

## Your Task

Help me plan and create a new shared prompt fragment. Follow this process:

1. **Understanding Phase:**
   - Ask me what this shared fragment should contain
   - Ask me what use case it serves
   - Ask me which commands might use this fragment
   - Ask me what the template variable name should be (format: {{VARIABLE_NAME}})

2. **Analysis Phase:**
   - Check if similar functionality already exists in current shared fragments
   - Suggest whether this should be:
     - A new shared fragment
     - Added to an existing shared fragment
     - Better as command-specific text
   - Identify which existing commands could benefit from this fragment

3. **Planning Phase:**
   - Show me the proposed fragment content
   - Show me the proposed file name (kebab-case.txt)
   - Show me the proposed template variable name ({{UPPER_SNAKE_CASE}})
   - List which commands should use this fragment

4. **Confirmation Phase:**
   - Ask me to confirm the plan before creating files
   - Once confirmed, create the shared fragment file
   - List which command files I should update to use the new fragment

**Do not create any files until I explicitly confirm the plan.**
