Testing and Documentation Standards

## Test Coverage Requirements
- New features: Add tests before marking PR complete
- Bug fixes: Write failing test first, then fix
- Public APIs: Test all exposed interfaces
- Business logic: Cover edge cases and error conditions

## Test Organization
- Unit tests: Individual functions in isolation
- Integration tests: Component interactions
- E2E tests: Complete user workflows
- Name tests: test_function_scenario_expectedResult

## Test Quality
- Each test should verify one specific behavior
- Use clear arrange/act/assert structure
- Mock external dependencies (APIs, databases, filesystem)
- Tests should be deterministic and isolated

## Documentation Requirements
- Public APIs: Document parameters, return types, exceptions
- Complex logic: Explain the "why", not just the "what"
- README: Keep usage examples up to date
- Breaking changes: Document migration path

## When to Document
- Non-obvious design decisions
- Performance considerations or trade-offs
- Security implications
- Deprecated features with alternatives

## Documentation Style
- Be concise and scannable
- Use code examples for clarity
- Keep examples simple and focused
- Update docs when changing APIs
