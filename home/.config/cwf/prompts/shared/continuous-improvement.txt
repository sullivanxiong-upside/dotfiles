# Continuous Improvement

**Proactively suggest improvements to workflow and coding practices**

When you discover practices during development that:
- Significantly improve workflow efficiency
- Prevent common mistakes or errors
- Would benefit future work across the codebase
- Should be standardized across the team

**Suggest adding them to the appropriate location:**

1. **Category-Specific Rules** (`~/.claude-<category>-rules`):
   - Practices specific to one workflow type (feature, review, customer-mgmt)
   - Command-specific patterns or requirements

2. **Shared Fragments** (`~/.config/cwf/prompts/shared/<fragment>.txt`):
   - Practices that apply across multiple workflows
   - Reusable guidance that multiple commands need

3. **Repository Rules** (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`):
   - Codebase-specific patterns and conventions
   - Technical standards for the specific repository

4. **Global CLAUDE.md** (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`):
   - Environment and tooling guidance
   - Cross-repository standards
   - Development environment setup

**When to suggest improvements:**
- After completing a non-trivial task
- When you notice repeated patterns that could be codified
- When you find a better approach than existing practices
- When documentation or guidelines prevented an issue

**How to suggest:**
- Clearly explain the improvement and its benefits
- Provide specific examples of how it helps
- Suggest where the guidance should be documented
- Offer to help implement the documentation update
