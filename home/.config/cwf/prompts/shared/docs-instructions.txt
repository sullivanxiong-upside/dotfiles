# Documentation Instructions

**Check for repository documentation before starting work:**

1. **Repository-Level Documentation:**
   - Read `CLAUDE.md` in the repository root for repo-specific guidance
   - Check `README.md` for setup instructions and architecture overview
   - Look for `docs/` directory with additional specifications

2. **Feature-Specific Documentation:**
   - Check for related design documents or specs in `docs/`
   - Look for architectural decision records (ADRs)
   - Review any migration guides or planning documents

3. **Code-Level Documentation:**
   - Read comments and docstrings in files you're modifying
   - Check for inline TODOs or FIXMEs that might be related
   - Review test files for expected behavior

4. **When Documentation is Missing:**
   - Ask the user for clarification on expected behavior
   - Suggest creating documentation if it would benefit the team
   - Document your own changes appropriately

**Never skip reading documentation - it prevents rework and ensures consistency with team patterns.**
