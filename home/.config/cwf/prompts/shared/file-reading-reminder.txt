# File Reading Reminder

**CRITICAL: Always read files before modifying them**

- Never modify a file without reading it first using the Read tool
- Never assume file contents - always verify before making changes
- When editing multiple related files, read all of them first to understand the full context
- Check existing patterns and conventions in the file before adding new code
- Verify imports, dependencies, and references in the file

This prevents:
- Breaking existing functionality
- Introducing inconsistencies with existing code style
- Duplicating code that already exists
- Missing important context or edge cases
