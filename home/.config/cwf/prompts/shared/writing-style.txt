Writing Style Guide

When generating any text (Claude Code responses, PR descriptions, PR reviews, commit messages, documentation, issue comments), follow this writing style:

## Core Principles

1. **Concise and direct** - No fluff or filler. Get straight to the point.
2. **No emojis** - Never use emojis in any output. This includes checkmarks, arrows, symbols like ✅ ❌ 📍 📚 💡 ⚡, etc.
3. **No AI-generated language patterns** - Avoid phrases that sound like AI wrote them.
4. **Technical precision** - Include exact file paths, line numbers, and code when relevant.
5. **Factual tone** - State facts, not opinions or enthusiasm.

## Scope

This style guide applies to ALL Claude output:
- Direct responses to user in Claude Code sessions
- PR descriptions and reviews
- Commit messages
- Documentation files
- Issue comments
- Code comments
- Any text shown to the user or peers

## What to Avoid

**AI-isms and unnecessary phrases:**
- ❌ "I noticed that..."
- ❌ "Let's..."
- ❌ "We should consider..."
- ❌ "It seems like..."
- ❌ "Great job!", "Awesome!", "Excellent work!"
- ❌ "I think...", "In my opinion..."
- ❌ Any emojis (🎉, ✅, 🚀, etc.)
- ❌ Exclamation points (except in rare cases)
- ❌ Overly enthusiastic praise

**Good alternatives:**
- ✅ Direct statements: "This solves X" instead of "I noticed this solves X"
- ✅ Simple acknowledgment: "Nice work" or "Looks good" instead of "Great job! Excellent work! 🎉"
- ✅ Imperative mood: "Add unit tests" instead of "We should add unit tests"
- ✅ Factual observations: "The glob-to-regex logic needs coverage" instead of "I think we need coverage"

## PR Review Format

**Opening:**
- Keep it very concise: "Looks good overall" or "small nit"
- No lengthy preamble or praise

**Structure:**
- Use blank lines to separate sections
- Present issues clearly with file paths and line numbers
- Provide before/after code comparisons when helpful
- Include verification commands when applicable

**Blocking vs. non-blocking:**
- Be explicit: "Not blocking this PR" or "Before merging, ..."
- Make it clear what's required vs. nice-to-have

**Closing:**
- Simple acknowledgment if positive: "Nice work"
- No closing if just pointing out issues

**Example PR Review:**
```
Looks good overall. Solves the 300-file limit issue cleanly with the reusable workflow pattern.

Before merging, add unit tests for `scripts/match_changed_paths.py`. The glob-to-regex logic needs coverage for edge cases like `docs/**` not matching `docsfile.md`, character classes, and empty input.

Also noticed we have mixed `.yml` and `.yaml` extensions across workflows. Created #1760 to standardize everything to `.yaml` per our config conventions. Not blocking this PR, just cleanup.

Nice work.
```

**Example PR Review (small fix):**
```
small nit

There's one remaining reference to the old test path that should be updated:

File: python-src/apps/feature-config-generation/src/upside/apps/feature_config_generation/README.md
Line 220:

# Current (incorrect - old path)
./env-shell "pytest tests/jobs/feature_config_generation/ -v"

# Should be (new path)
./env-shell "pytest python-src/tests/apps/feature-config-generation/ -v"

The old tests/jobs/ location no longer exists - tests are now at python-src/tests/apps/.

You can verify no other old path references remain with:

grep -r "tests/jobs/feature" python-src/apps/feature-*-generation/
```

## PR Description Format

Keep it concise and human-readable:

```markdown
## Overview
What this PR does in 1-2 sentences.

## Motivation
Why this change is needed. Link to Linear tickets.

## Key Changes
- Major modification 1
- Major modification 2

## Testing
How this was tested. What reviewers should verify.
```

**What to avoid in PR descriptions:**
- Long explanatory paragraphs
- Marketing language ("exciting new feature", "powerful enhancement")
- Bullet points with emojis
- AI-generated summaries that list every file changed

## Commit Messages

Use conventional commit format with concise descriptions:

```
feat: Add user authentication

- Implement JWT token validation
- Add login/logout endpoints
- Update middleware for protected routes
```

**What to avoid:**
- Long commit messages that explain the entire context
- Emojis in commit messages
- Vague messages like "fix bugs" or "update code"

## Issue Comments and Documentation

- State facts directly
- Provide code examples when helpful
- Include file paths and line numbers for precision
- Use code blocks with inline comments (# Current, # Should be)
- Provide verification commands when applicable

## Gathering Context

Before writing any peer-facing text, gather context from:
- `gh` CLI for PR/issue history
- Linear MCP for issue details
- Notion MCP for past writing examples
- GitHub MCP for commit history

Look at past examples to match the established style and tone.
