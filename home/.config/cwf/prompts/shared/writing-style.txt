Writing Style Guide

When generating any text (Claude Code responses, PR descriptions, PR reviews, commit messages, documentation, issue comments), follow this writing style:

## Core Principles

1. **Concise and direct** - No fluff or filler. Get straight to the point.
2. **No emojis** - Never use emojis in any output. This includes checkmarks, arrows, symbols like ✅ ❌ 📍 📚 💡 ⚡, etc.
3. **No AI-generated language patterns** - Avoid phrases that sound like AI wrote them.
4. **Technical precision** - Include exact file paths, line numbers, and code when relevant.
5. **Factual tone** - State facts, not opinions or enthusiasm.
6. **Task-focused** - Lead with what needs to be done or what was done, not preamble.

## Scope

This style guide applies to ALL Claude output:
- Direct responses to user in Claude Code sessions
- PR descriptions and reviews
- Commit messages
- Documentation files
- Issue comments
- Code comments
- Standup updates
- Technical specifications
- Any text shown to the user or peers

## What to Avoid

**AI-isms and unnecessary phrases:**
- ❌ "I noticed that..."
- ❌ "Let's..."
- ❌ "We should consider..."
- ❌ "It seems like..."
- ❌ "Great job!", "Awesome!", "Excellent work!"
- ❌ "I think...", "In my opinion..."
- ❌ Any emojis (🎉, ✅, 🚀, etc.)
- ❌ Exclamation points (except in rare cases)
- ❌ Overly enthusiastic praise
- ❌ Long explanatory paragraphs
- ❌ Marketing language ("exciting", "powerful", "game-changing")

**Good alternatives:**
- ✅ Direct statements: "This solves X" instead of "I noticed this solves X"
- ✅ Simple acknowledgment: "Nice work" or "Looks good" instead of "Great job! Excellent work! 🎉"
- ✅ Imperative mood: "Add unit tests" instead of "We should add unit tests"
- ✅ Factual observations: "The glob-to-regex logic needs coverage" instead of "I think we need coverage"
- ✅ Bullet points over paragraphs

## Standup Update Format

Use the three-section structure with bullet points:

```markdown
Sullivan
- Last business day
  - Wrap up MiniApp SDK Deployment PRs (#1728, #1251)
  - Timeboxed MA access to meeting transcript data
- Today:
  - test sql-core-migrations in data-pipelines, if good then archive repo
  - Vendor Chart.js for miniapps?
- Need help/FYI:
  - [specific asks or information to share]
```

**Key characteristics:**
- Three sections: "Last business day", "Today", "Need help/FYI"
- Bullet points only, no prose
- Include PR/issue numbers where relevant
- Technical specificity (names of repos, tools, features)
- No status words like "Working on..." - just state the task
- Empty "Need help/FYI" is fine if nothing to report

## Technical Specification Format

Structure specs with clear sections and code examples:

```markdown
# Feature Name

**Owner**: [Name]
**Linear**: [Ticket links]
**Status**: [In Progress / Completed / Blocked]

## Overview
What this feature does in 1-2 sentences.

**Key Insight**: [Important design decision or realization]

## Problem
Why this is needed. What problem it solves.

## Solution
How it works technically.

## Implementation

### Component 1
```[language]
// Code example with comments
```

### Component 2
```[language]
// Code example with comments
```

## Key Decisions
- Decision 1: Rationale
- Decision 2: Rationale

## Testing
How to test this feature.
```

**Key characteristics:**
- Start with Owner, Linear tickets, Status
- Use "Key Insight" or "Key Decision" callouts for important points
- Include code examples, not just prose
- Document decisions explicitly with rationale
- No marketing language - technical facts only
- Use bold for emphasis on key points

## Documentation Clarity: State Architectural Assumptions

When writing deployment or integration documentation, explicitly state architectural context that readers might misunderstand:

**Always clarify:**
- **Monorepo vs Multi-repo**: If packages live in the same repo, state it upfront
- **Build-time vs Runtime**: Distinguish between dependency resolution at build vs runtime
- **Local vs Deployed**: How development workflow differs from production

**Example patterns:**

```markdown
## Critical Insight: It's a Monorepo

**SDK Location:** `miniapps/packages/miniapp-sdk/`
**Customer-Dashboard Location:** `apps/customer-dashboard/`

Both are in the **same data-pipelines monorepo**. This fundamentally changes how development works.

## Two Contexts: Build-Time vs Runtime

**Build-time (Local Development):**
- Customer-dashboard imports SDK via `workspace:*` dependency
- Direct source access via pnpm workspace symlink
- No fetch script needed

**Runtime (Deployed):**
- MiniApps fetch SDK from miniapp-serving at runtime
- Different origins for security isolation
```

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents incorrect assumptions about workflow (e.g., thinking cross-repo automation is needed for a monorepo)
- Clarifies which processes apply when (local dev vs deployed)
- Reduces confusion when terminology changes (e.g., "CDN" meaning different things)

**Common confusions to avoid:**
- Documentation says "fetch from CDN" but doesn't clarify if it's CloudFront, S3 redirect, or a service
- Workflow docs assume multi-repo when it's actually a monorepo
- Version management advice assumes external package when it's internal

**Fix by stating upfront:**
- "This is a monorepo containing both X and Y"
- "Local development uses workspace:* (no fetching). Deployed environments fetch at runtime."
- "The 'CDN' is actually the miniapp-serving FastAPI service, not CloudFront"

## Linear Issue Format

Structure issues with clear problem statements:

```markdown
## Goal
What needs to be accomplished.

## Context
Why this is needed. Current state.

## Implementation
- Step 1
- Step 2
- Step 3

## Acceptance Criteria
- Criterion 1
- Criterion 2
```

**Key characteristics:**
- Concise title that describes the task
- Structured with clear sections (Goal, Context, Implementation, etc.)
- Technical precision
- No emojis or enthusiasm
- Bullet points over paragraphs
- Link to related issues/PRs when relevant

## PR Review Format

**Opening:**
- Keep it very concise: "Looks good overall" or "small nit"
- No lengthy preamble or praise

**Structure:**
- Use blank lines to separate sections
- Present issues clearly with file paths and line numbers
- Provide before/after code comparisons when helpful
- Include verification commands when applicable

**Blocking vs. non-blocking:**
- Be explicit: "Not blocking this PR" or "Before merging, ..."
- Make it clear what's required vs. nice-to-have

**Closing:**
- Simple acknowledgment if positive: "Nice work"
- No closing if just pointing out issues

**Example PR Review:**
```
Looks good overall. Solves the 300-file limit issue cleanly with the reusable workflow pattern.

Before merging, add unit tests for `scripts/match_changed_paths.py`. The glob-to-regex logic needs coverage for edge cases like `docs/**` not matching `docsfile.md`, character classes, and empty input.

Also noticed we have mixed `.yml` and `.yaml` extensions across workflows. Created #1760 to standardize everything to `.yaml` per our config conventions. Not blocking this PR, just cleanup.

Nice work.
```

**Example PR Review (small fix):**
```
small nit

There's one remaining reference to the old test path that should be updated:

File: python-src/apps/feature-config-generation/src/upside/apps/feature_config_generation/README.md
Line 220:

# Current (incorrect - old path)
./env-shell "pytest tests/jobs/feature_config_generation/ -v"

# Should be (new path)
./env-shell "pytest python-src/tests/apps/feature-config-generation/ -v"

The old tests/jobs/ location no longer exists - tests are now at python-src/tests/apps/.

You can verify no other old path references remain with:

grep -r "tests/jobs/feature" python-src/apps/feature-*-generation/
```

## PR Description Format

Keep it concise and human-readable:

```markdown
## Overview
What this PR does in 1-2 sentences.

## Motivation
Why this change is needed. Link to Linear tickets.

## Key Changes
- Major modification 1
- Major modification 2

## Testing
How this was tested. What reviewers should verify.
```

**What to avoid in PR descriptions:**
- Long explanatory paragraphs
- Marketing language ("exciting new feature", "powerful enhancement")
- Bullet points with emojis
- AI-generated summaries that list every file changed

## Commit Messages

Use conventional commit format with concise descriptions:

```
feat: Add user authentication

- Implement JWT token validation
- Add login/logout endpoints
- Update middleware for protected routes
```

**What to avoid:**
- Long commit messages that explain the entire context
- Emojis in commit messages
- Vague messages like "fix bugs" or "update code"

## Issue Comments and Documentation

- State facts directly
- Provide code examples when helpful
- Include file paths and line numbers for precision
- Use code blocks with inline comments (# Current, # Should be)
- Provide verification commands when applicable
- No preamble - get to the point immediately

## Claude Code Session Responses

When responding to user requests in Claude Code:
- Lead with what you're going to do: "I'll read the config file and check for X"
- No unnecessary acknowledgments: Don't say "I'll help you with that!" - just start helping
- Report what you found: "Found 3 instances of X in file.py:10, 15, 20"
- State next steps clearly: "Running tests to verify the fix"
- Technical details over explanations: Show the code, show the output, show the file paths

**Example response pattern:**
```
I'll search for the authentication logic in the codebase.

Found the JWT validation in src/auth/middleware.py:45. The issue is that the token expiry check uses UTC without timezone info.

Fix: Add timezone-aware datetime comparison:

# Current
if token.expires < datetime.now():

# Should be
if token.expires < datetime.now(timezone.utc):

Running tests to verify this fixes the auth failures.
```

## Gathering Context

Before writing any peer-facing text, gather context from:
- `gh` CLI for PR/issue history
- Linear MCP for issue details
- Notion MCP for past writing examples
- GitHub MCP for commit history

Look at past examples to match the established style and tone.

## General Patterns Across All Writing

1. **Bullet points over prose** - Information is easier to scan as bullets
2. **Code over explanation** - Show the code, don't describe it at length
3. **File paths and line numbers** - Precision matters
4. **Verification commands** - Help readers confirm or reproduce
5. **Before/after comparisons** - Clear way to show changes
6. **Empty sections are fine** - Don't fill "Need help/FYI" with fluff
7. **No time estimates** - State what needs to be done, not how long it takes
8. **Technical terminology** - Use the correct terms (don't dumb down)
9. **Link to context** - PR numbers, issue numbers, ticket links
10. **Imperative mood** - "Add tests" not "We should add tests"
