Git Safety Protocol

Before any git operations (add, commit, push, pull, merge, rebase):
- Run git status to verify working tree state and staged changes
- Check git remote -v to confirm correct remote repository
- Run git branch to verify you're on the correct branch
- Review git log --oneline -5 to understand recent commit history
- For push operations: verify you're not force-pushing to protected branches (main/master)

This ensures you understand the full context before making potentially irreversible changes.

## Maintaining Good Git History

**Use `git mv` for file and directory moves** instead of deleting and recreating:

When restructuring directories or moving files:
- ✅ `git mv old/path/file.py new/path/file.py` - Preserves file history
- ❌ `rm old/path/file.py && cp new/path/file.py && git add .` - Breaks history

Git tracks file moves when you use `git mv`, making it easier to trace changes over time with `git log --follow`.

**For directory restructures:**
```bash
# Moving multiple files
git mv src/old_package/* src/new_package/

# Renaming a directory
git mv old_directory/ new_directory/
```

**Why this matters:**
- Preserves `git blame` history across file moves
- Makes `git log --follow <file>` work correctly
- Helps reviewers understand what changed vs. what moved
- Keeps git history clean and traceable
