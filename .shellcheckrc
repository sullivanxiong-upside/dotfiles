# ShellCheck configuration for dotfiles repository
# These are style warnings that don't affect functionality

# SC2155: Declare and assign separately to avoid masking return values
# Common pattern in cwf/gwf scripts, not a functional issue
disable=SC2155

# SC2139: Variable expansion in alias definitions
# Intentional behavior in bash-aliases.sh, variables should expand at definition time
disable=SC2139

# SC2001: Use ${variable//search/replace} instead of sed
# Sed is more readable for complex patterns, this is a style preference
disable=SC2001

# SC2181: Check exit code directly instead of $?
# Sometimes checking $? is more readable, especially with complex conditions
disable=SC2181

# SC1090: ShellCheck can't follow non-constant source
# Dynamic sourcing is intentional in shell configs
disable=SC1090

# SC2162: read without -r will mangle backslashes
# Not a concern for simple input parsing
disable=SC2162

# SC2178: Variable was used as an array but is now assigned a string
# SC2128: Expanding an array without an index only gives the first element
# Array handling is intentional in these scripts
disable=SC2178
