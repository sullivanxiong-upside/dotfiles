# ShellCheck configuration for dotfiles repository
# These are style warnings that don't affect functionality

# SC2155: Declare and assign separately to avoid masking return values
# Common pattern in cwf/gwf scripts, not a functional issue
disable=SC2155

# SC2139: Variable expansion in alias definitions
# Intentional behavior in bash-aliases.sh, variables should expand at definition time
disable=SC2139

# SC2001: Use ${variable//search/replace} instead of sed
# Sed is more readable for complex patterns, this is a style preference
disable=SC2001

# SC2181: Check exit code directly instead of $?
# Sometimes checking $? is more readable, especially with complex conditions
disable=SC2181

# SC1090: ShellCheck can't follow non-constant source
# Dynamic sourcing is intentional in shell configs
disable=SC1090

# SC2162: read without -r will mangle backslashes
# Not a concern for simple input parsing
disable=SC2162

# SC2178: Variable was used as an array but is now assigned a string
# SC2128: Expanding an array without an index only gives the first element
# Array handling is intentional in these scripts
disable=SC2178
disable=SC2128

# SC2207: Prefer mapfile or read -a to split command output
# Current pattern works fine for package lists
disable=SC2207

# SC2002: Useless cat
# Cat with pipes is more readable for chained commands
disable=SC2002

# SC2164: Use 'cd ... || exit' or 'cd ... || return'
# Directory changes are safe in these contexts
disable=SC2164

# SC2016: Expressions don't expand in single quotes
# Single quotes are intentional for literal strings
disable=SC2016

# SC2030: Modification of variable is local (to subshell caused by pipeline)
# SC2031: Variable was modified in a subshell, change might be lost
# Subshell behavior is understood and intentional
disable=SC2030
disable=SC2031
