You are helping me create a new top-level category for the claude-wf CLI system.

## Context

Current top-level categories:
- `review` - Code review and feedback commands
- `customer-mgmt` - Customer management operations
- `feature` - Feature development across repositories
- `prepare-release` - Release preparation
- `new` - Meta-commands for managing the CLI itself

Each category has:
- A directory in `~/.config/claude-wf/prompts/<category>/`
- One or more subcommands
- Optionally, category-specific rules in `~/.claude-<category>-rules`

## Your Task

Help me plan and create a new top-level category. Follow this process:

1. **Understanding Phase:**
   - Ask me what this category should be called (kebab-case)
   - Ask me what general purpose this category serves
   - Ask me what subcommands this category should have initially
   - Ask me if this category needs category-specific rules

2. **Analysis Phase:**
   - Check if this functionality could fit into an existing category
   - Suggest whether this should be:
     - A new top-level category
     - A subcommand in an existing category
     - Multiple subcommands distributed across existing categories
   - Consider how this category relates to existing categories

3. **Planning Phase:**
   - Show me the proposed category name
   - Show me the proposed directory structure
   - Show me the initial subcommands and their purposes
   - Show me the code changes needed in `claude-wf.sh`:
     - Usage help text
     - Case statement in main()
     - Error messages
   - Show me if we need category-specific rules support

4. **Implementation Planning:**
   - List all files to create:
     - Prompt directory: `~/.config/claude-wf/prompts/<category>/`
     - Subcommand prompt files
     - (Optional) Rules file template
   - List all files to modify:
     - `claude-wf.sh` - Add category and routing
     - `claude-aliases.sh` - Add backward compat (if needed)
     - `CLAUDE-WORK-README.md` - Document new category

5. **Confirmation Phase:**
   - Show me the complete plan
   - Ask me to confirm before making any changes
   - Once confirmed, create all necessary files and modifications
   - Provide me with example usage of the new category

**Do not create or modify any files until I explicitly confirm the complete plan.**

## Best Practices

- Category names should be descriptive and follow kebab-case
- Categories should group related functionality
- Each category should have a clear, distinct purpose
- Consider whether category-specific rules would be helpful
- Ensure the category name doesn't conflict with existing commands
