Generate release notes following the format specified in @.cursor/rules/release-notes.mdc (if available).

## Process:

1. Use git CLI to compare origin/prod (base) to origin/main
2. Get the full commit messages and descriptions for all commits
3. For each commit, list the files changed
4. Use 'gh pr view' to fetch PR titles and descriptions to find linked Linear tickets
5. Categorize each change (remember: ONE entry per PR/commit):
   - Customer Impacting / Logical Updates (changes to data processing, datasets, customer configs)
   - Operational Improvements (performance, infrastructure, doesn't change end product)
   - Minor Bug Fixes & Patches

## Format

Format each entry as:
{summary of change} (#{pr_number}) (ref {LINEAR-123})

**CRITICAL:** Each PR must appear exactly ONCE in the release notes, under the most relevant section.

Output the release notes in a markdown code block.
