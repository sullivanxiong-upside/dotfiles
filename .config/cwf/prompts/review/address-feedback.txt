I need help addressing peer feedback on my current feature branch.

First, analyze the current branch context:
1. Get the current branch name
2. Get the list of all commits on this branch (compare against main branch)
3. Get the full diff of changes on this branch compared to main
4. Identify the purpose and goals of this feature branch based on:
   - Branch name
   - Commit messages
   - Actual code changes

Then help me understand:
- What is the overall purpose of this feature branch?
- What has been implemented so far?
- What are the key components and changes?

After understanding the context, I'll provide you with peer feedback and you should:
- Analyze how the feedback relates to the existing changes
- Determine what needs to be modified, added, or removed
- Suggest the best approach to address each piece of feedback
- Identify any potential conflicts or considerations with existing implementation
- Help implement the necessary changes

Be thorough in your analysis and ask clarifying questions if the feedback is ambiguous or if you need more context about the intended behavior.
