Git Safety Protocol

Before any git operations (add, commit, push, pull, merge, rebase):
- Run git status to verify working tree state and staged changes
- Check git remote -v to confirm correct remote repository
- Run git branch to verify you're on the correct branch
- Review git log --oneline -5 to understand recent commit history
- For push operations: verify you're not force-pushing to protected branches (main/master)

This ensures you understand the full context before making potentially irreversible changes.
