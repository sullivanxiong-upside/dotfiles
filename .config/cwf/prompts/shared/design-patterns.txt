We should follow good design patterns that fit the feature, so look at https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/creational-patterns, https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/structural-patterns, and https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/behavioral-patterns. Decide if for creational design patterns it makes more sense to go with Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype, or Singleton for some approaches. Decide if for Structural Design patterns if we should use Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy, or Wrapper for some approaches. For behavioral design patterns decide if we should go with Chain of Responsibility, Command, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template, Visitor. Also look to see if there are already existing patterns in the code base and if the new feature follows those patterns.
