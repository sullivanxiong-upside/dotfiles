## Planning Guidelines

**When to Plan:**
For non-trivial tasks that involve multiple steps, architectural decisions, or significant code changes:
- Use EnterPlanMode to explore the codebase and design an implementation approach
- Present the plan for approval before implementing
- Examples: new features, refactoring, adding new commands, architectural changes

**When NOT to Plan:**
For trivial tasks that can be completed quickly in a few prompt cycles:
- Skip planning and implement directly
- Examples: typo fixes, single-line changes, adding comments, simple bug fixes

**Rule of Thumb:**
- If uncertain whether to plan, err on the side of planning - it's better to get alignment upfront than to redo work
- Planning is especially valuable when the user hasn't provided very specific, detailed instructions
