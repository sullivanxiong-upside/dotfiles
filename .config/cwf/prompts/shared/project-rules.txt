Project-Specific Rules Detection

IMPORTANT: Before starting work, check for and follow project-specific rules in the current repository.

## Rule Files to Check

Search current directory and parent directories (up to git root) for:
- `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` - Cursor IDE rules (MDC format)
- `.cursorrules` - Single file cursor rules
- `.clinerules` - Claude Code CLI rules
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Project contribution guidelines
- `.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` - Contribution guidelines

## Rule Priority

When conflicts exist:
1. Project-specific rules (highest)
2. Category-specific rules
3. Shared/general rules (lowest)

## What to Look For

- Coding standards and style guides
- Workflow requirements (e.g., mandatory todo tracking)
- Testing and documentation requirements
- Git commit conventions
- File organization patterns
- Technology-specific guidelines

## Action Required

At the START of each task:
1. Use Glob to search: `**/.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, `**/.cursorrules`, `**/.clinerules`, `**/CONTRIBUTING.md`
2. Read any found rule files
3. Acknowledge which rules you found
4. Follow them throughout the task

**Never skip this step** - project-specific rules are critical for consistency.
