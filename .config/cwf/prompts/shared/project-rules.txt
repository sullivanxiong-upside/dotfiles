# Project-Specific Rules Detection

IMPORTANT: Before starting any work, you MUST check for and follow project-specific rules in the current repository.

## Rule Files to Check

Check the current working directory and parent directories (up to git root) for these files:

1. **`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`** - Cursor IDE rule files (MDC format)
2. **`.cursorrules`** - Single file cursor rules
3. **`.clinerules`** - Claude Code CLI rules
4. **`.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`** - Contribution guidelines
5. **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** - Project contribution rules
6. Any other project-specific rule files

## Detection Process

1. Search the current directory for rule files
2. If not found, search parent directories up to the git root (`.git/` directory)
3. Read and parse all found rule files
4. Apply the rules to your current task

## Rule Priority

Project-specific rules take precedence over general rules. If there's a conflict:
1. Project-specific rules (highest priority)
2. Category-specific rules
3. Shared/general rules (lowest priority)

## Common Rule Locations

- `.cursor/rules/` - Modern Cursor IDE rules
- Root directory - `.cursorrules`, `.clinerules`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `.github/` directory - Contribution guidelines, templates

## What to Look For

When you find rule files, pay attention to:
- Coding standards and style guides
- Workflow requirements (e.g., mandatory todo tracking)
- Testing requirements
- Documentation requirements
- Git commit conventions
- File organization patterns
- Technology-specific guidelines

## Action Required

At the START of each task:
1. Use Glob tool to search for rule files: `**/.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, `**/.cursorrules`, etc.
2. Read any found rule files
3. Acknowledge which rules you found
4. Follow them throughout the task

**Never skip this step** - project-specific rules are critical for maintaining consistency and following the project's workflow.
