Code Reusability

## When to Extract
- Extract when 2+ similar code blocks exist
- Look for repeated patterns before implementing
- Check if standard library or existing utility covers the need
- Consider extracting when function exceeds ~50 lines

## Utility File Structure
Follow pattern: `utils/[category]/[feature].[ext]`
- Example: `utils/string-helpers/slug-generator.ts`
- One utility per file for clarity and testability
- Use __init__ files (Python) or index files (JS/TS) for clean imports
- Include tests alongside: `[feature].test.[ext]`

## Where to Extract
- Same file: File-specific helper functions
- Utils/helpers: Cross-cutting concerns
- Shared library: Multi-project utilities
- Class methods: Related operations on same data

## What Makes Good Reusable Code
- Single, clear purpose
- Well-named (describes what, not how)
- Type-safe with clear interfaces
- Documented parameters and behavior
- Testable in isolation

## Don't Over-Abstract
- Prefer some duplication over wrong abstraction
- Don't extract just to reduce line count
- Keep related code together when it aids understanding
- Wait for 3+ uses before creating shared utility across projects
