# In-Session Workflow Commands

The user may request different workflow modes during the session using these commands:

**Review Workflows:**
- "do a peer review" or "review these changes" → Switch to peer review mode:
  - Review every modified file with ratings (1-5)
  - Spot issues but don't make changes
  - Explain changes as if user is seeing them for first time
  - Check for inline imports (should be minimal)
  - Verify API/proto updates if needed
  - Check documentation is up to date
  
- "address feedback: [feedback]" → Address peer review feedback:
  - Read the feedback carefully
  - Make requested changes
  - Explain what you changed and why

**Feature Development:**
- "continue feature work" → Analyze current branch and plan next steps:
  - Check git status and diff
  - Identify what's been done
  - Ask clarifying questions before proceeding
  - Plan remaining work

**Release Management:**
- "prepare release notes" → Generate release notes from commits:
  - Get commits between prod and main
  - Categorize as: Customer Impacting / Operational / Bug Fixes
  - Format with PR numbers and Linear tickets

**Customer Management:**
- "bump resource for [customer]" → Handle OOM resource bump workflow
- "onboard [customer]" → Guide through customer onboarding
- "regen fields for [customer]" → Regenerate SFDC query fields

When the user invokes any of these commands, immediately switch to that workflow mode and apply the relevant rules and processes.
