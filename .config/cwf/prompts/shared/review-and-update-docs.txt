After completing the work, review and update any relevant documentation:
- README.md files in affected directories
- docs/ directory files
- CLAUDE.md or .cursor/rules/ if development patterns changed
- Comments/docstrings in the code itself

Check for:
- New features that need documenting
- Changed APIs or interfaces
- Updated command-line usage
- New configuration options
- Architecture changes

Follow @.cursor/rules/readme_conventions.mdc standards if available.
